Following her husband, President Ziaur Rahman's assassination in 1981, she entered politics and assumed leadership of the BNP in 1984. She is renowned for leading the anti-Ershad movement that restored democracy in 1990. Her premierships were marked by significant reforms in education and economics. After years of imprisonment on corruption charges, she was released on humanitarian grounds in 2020. Following the mass uprising in August 2024, she was fully released, and in early 2025, she was acquitted in the remaining corruption case, clearing her path to contest the upcoming 2026 general election from multiple constituencies."
